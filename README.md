This repository is all about doing preliminary research on the following topics:

#### Packets and Protocols
- What’s a packet? What’s in it?
- How do TCP and UDP work?
- What are the major differences?
- What is each protocol used for?

#### Networks and Routers

#### Web Security Issues
- How does a firewall work?
- What is a DDoS attack?
- How does HTTPS/SSL/TLS work?
- What is SQL injection? (if time)
